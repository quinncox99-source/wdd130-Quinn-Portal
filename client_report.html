<h1  >Me as a Client</h1>
<p  >As a client I made everything myself, I wrote up the text, I made the images in google drawings, and I came up with the wireframes.</p>
<p  >I communicated through discord, my favourite kind of group chat, and I had a few issues communicating although that was mostly on my end as it took me a while to make all of the images.</p>
<p  >I think the developers met all my expectations with this site, it is amazing and perfectly follows what I gave them.</p>
<p  >Though I think next time I hire a team to do a project for me I will make sure I have all of the images and wireframes up front.</p>

<h1  >Being a Project Lead</h1>
<p  >I think we did well, I used discord to comunicate with them and my teammates were amazing and it was a really fun learning experience.</p>
<p  >I also communicated through discord with them and while their wireframe was missing a few things at first all it took was a few simple questions to get everything.</p>
<p  >While it took me a while to publish my site I did get it working, I did forget to give my client their product, but luckily I was reminded by my teacher.</p>
<p  >Overall  while I had to figure a few things out I am very proud of how I managed this site on GitHub and I will use Github more in future projects.</p>

<h1  >My learning experience as a Junior Dev</h1>
<p  >I forgot how to contact both of my project leaders, I forgot their faces, and did not ask for help when I could.</p>
<p  >I was supposed to do one of the pages however I did not have access to communications and realized to late that this was something I need to fix. </p>
<p  >I was not able to contribute to either of their sites and that is a fatal mistake that I will try to learn from.</p>
<p  >I didnt want to bother the lead devs by making changes this late into the project and I would probably have to remake most of what other people did as I wouldnt understand their code well.</p>

<h1  >Overall</h1>
<p  >The most challenging part of this project was understanding other peoples code. Sadly I was not able to overcome this and either reinvented systems or went mad.</p>
<p  >The thing I enjoyed most about this project is the exchange, where you get a project and make it with precision, where you have everything you need to make it and you just do it.</p>
<p  >One of the main things I would do if I were to do this project again would be to not lose everyones contacts and get better at documentation and neat code.</p>
<p  >Overall I would say this entire project has made me more confident at working on real-world projects becuase I now know what not to do, and some of the things that work.</p>
